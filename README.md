# Blackjack Project

## Topics

#### In this game a user is welcomed to the casino and is invited to play Blackjack with "Yes" or "No" options, as well as an option to see a shuffled deck as per the requirements of this assignment. Should the player choose to play a game of Blackjack the game allows the player to see the dealer's "up" card as well as the value of their own hand and the cards listed specifically in their own hand and may decide if they would like to "hit" or "stay". the dealer's turn is next and the dealer follows the rules of the game to play against player. In the even of the player or dealer going over, the game displays a "bust" for whoever lost and displays that the opposite player has won. Winning and loosing cards are displayed at the end of the game so the player may see what the dealer had as opposed to what they had. 

#### During this project I became more familiar with how calling different methods and classes worked in relation to eachother. It was difficult for me to track which methods where being called where before this project, and I still struggle with it but felt as though it began to "click" during this project. I am very excited to continue to growing in this area. This is a fun game and had not played it before being asked to complete this assignment. 

#### This project also helped me learn more about how object-oriented programming works and enjoyed the fact that when calling a class or method, it was usually named with a name that made sense, such as the dealer is the one who owns the deck, but is also a "kind-of" player. 

### Please Note:
I implemented this stretch goal:
> "Blackjack" hand - if the user is initially dealt an Ace and a card with the value 10, this is a blackjack. The user immediately wins unless the dealer also has a blackjack (two-card hand with an Ace and a 10-value card).

which directly seemed to conflict with:
> The game is immediately over if either player gets above 21.
