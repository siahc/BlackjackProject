# Blackjack Project

## Topics

### Learning Objectives

Below are a list of objectives that we see the blackjack programing reinforcing.

1. Getting comfortable building classes in an Object-Oriented manner.  
2. Building classes whose fields are Objects.  
3. Use collection types to organize and manage data.

4. Practice writing methods.

5. Use conditionals to create game logic.

### Please Note:
I implemented this stretch goal:
> "Blackjack" hand - if the user is initially dealt an Ace and a card with the value 10, this is a blackjack. The user immediately wins unless the dealer also has a blackjack (two-card hand with an Ace and a 10-value card).

which directly seemed to conflict with:
> The game is immediately over if either player gets above 21.
